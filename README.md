# Scala Sandbox

## Getting Started  with Scala

* A great [Gist to introduce Scala](https://gist.github.com/djspiewak/cb72c41ac335a3a9b28b3307be04aa43) from [djspiewak@github](https://github.com/djspiewak)
* For those know well about Java programming,  [Scala for Java Developers](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html) is a good start point.
* The official [Tour of Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html) provides a guide to go through Scala language feature.
* [All About Scala](https://allaboutscala.com/) is a community driven place to centralize  Scala related resources.

Get more [Getting Started](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html) resources from the official website.
