# Scala Sandbox



##  Getting Started

There are a lot of  resource is good to start a Scala application. 

* A great [Gist to introduce Scala](https://gist.github.com/djspiewak/cb72c41ac335a3a9b28b3307be04aa43) from [djspiewak@github](https://github.com/djspiewak)
* For those know well about Java programming,  [Scala for Java Developers](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html) is a good start point.
* The official [Tour of Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html) provides a guide to go through Scala language feature.
* [All About Scala](https://allaboutscala.com/) is a community driven place to centralize  Scala related resources.
* [Visual Scala Reference](https://superruzafa.github.com/visual-scala-reference/), a guide to visually learn about Scala concepts and functions.

## Video Courses

- Dr.Mark C Lewis from Trinity University, San Antonio, TX, teaches programming courses  using the Scala language. Course videos are available in YouTube for  free. Some of the courses below.     
  - [Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving Using Scala](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLMXbkbDbVt9MIJ9DV4ps-_trOzWtphYO)
  - [Object-Orientation, Abstraction, and Data Structures Using Scala](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLMXbkbDbVt8JLumqKj-3BlHmEXPIfR42)

- Functional Programming in Scala Specialization (on Coursera). The Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using Scala. You can access the courses material and exercises by either signing up for the specialization or auditing the courses individually. The specialization has the following courses.     
  - Functional Programming Principles in Scala ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) and [Open edX](https://courseware.epfl.ch/courses/course-v1:EPFL+progfun1+2018_T1/about)),
