# Scala Sandbox

## Getting Started  with Scala

* A great [Gist to introduce Scala]((https://gist.github.com/djspiewak/cb72c41ac335a3a9b28b3307be04aa43)) from [djspiewak@github](https://github.com/djspiewak)
* For those know well about Java programming,  [Scala for Java Developers](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html) is a good start point to learn Scala.
* The official [Tour of Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html) provides a guide to go through Scala language feature.
* [All About Scala](https://allaboutscala.com/) is a community driven place to centralize  Scala related resources.

Get more [Getting Started](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html) resources from the official website.

## Set up local development environment

After getting know the basic concept of Scala language, try to practice in codes.

Scala REPL is provide a shell  to evaluate expressions in an interactive mode.  [Download](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/) and get Scala installed.

1. Install Scala via SDKMan!,  and execute `scala` in your terminal.
2. Install Sbt, execute `sbt console` to launch Scala REPL console. 
3. [Ammonite](http://ammonite.io/) is a popular Scala REPL(for Linux users). 

Besides,   [Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org) and [ScalaFiddle](https://scalafiddle.io/) provide a sandbox to run Scala code snippets in a web browser.

To build a real world application, it is better to use a build tool to manage the project dependencies and build lifecycle.

*  [Sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org) is the most popular build tools for Scala projects
*  Alternatively, you can still build [Scala with Maven](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-with-maven.html)
*  [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/scala_plugin.html) officially supports Scala.

To work more productively, you could choose your favorite IDEs or text editor to write Scala codes.

* Intellij IDEA and Scala plugin
* Eclipse and [Scala IDE](https://www.scala-ide.org)
* VSCode and [Metals Scala Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals#overview)
* Apache NetBeans IDE  and nbscala(Not updated to the latest NetBeans and Scala)
